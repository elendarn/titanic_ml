# Titanic Survival Prediction using Machine Learning

## Introduction

This repository contains the code and data for my machine learning project on predicting the survival of passengers on the Titanic. The project is based on the classical Titanic dataset, which was originally used for the Titanic Kaggle prediction contest. The aim of this project is to develop accurate predictive models that can classify whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster or not.

## Project Description

The project goes through several stages, employing various techniques and algorithms to create robust predictive models. The main steps involved in this project include data cleaning, preprocessing, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model building using different machine learning algorithms.

The key highlights of this project are as follows:

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: The Titanic dataset may contain missing values, outliers, or inconsistent data. Therefore, comprehensive data cleaning and preprocessing steps are performed using libraries such as Pandas and Numpy. This ensures the dataset is ready for further analysis.

2. **Feature Engineering**: Additional features are created or extracted from the existing dataset to enhance the predictive power of the models. This process involves domain knowledge and creativity to derive meaningful features that capture important information related to survival.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: EDA techniques are employed to gain insights into the dataset, understand the relationships between variables, and identify patterns or trends that could be valuable for model building. Libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Pandas are used to visualize and analyze the data.

4. **Model Building**: Various machine learning algorithms, such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest, are applied to train predictive models. These models learn from the available features to classify passengers as survivors or non-survivors. The models are evaluated using appropriate evaluation metrics and cross-validation techniques.

5. **Hyperparameter Tuning and Optimization**: To improve the performance of the models, hyperparameter tuning is conducted using techniques like GridSearch. This process helps find the optimal combination of hyperparameters that maximize the model's accuracy and generalization ability.

6. **Submission and Results**: The project includes the submission of the predictions to the Titanic Kaggle prediction contest, showcasing the individual's skills and efforts. The initial results achieved in the contest are included, and further optimization strategies are discussed to potentially improve the accuracy and increase the chances of winning.
