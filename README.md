The machine learning project is created using the classical Titanic dataset for the Titanic Kaggle prediction contest. The project undergo several stages, including data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering using libraries such as Pandas and Numpy.

Different machine learning algorithms is employed, such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest, to create predictive models that accurately classified whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster or not.

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques and data visualization are employed (using libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Pandas) to analyze the data and gain insights, afterwards the models are build and optimized using hyperparameter tuning via feature selection and GridSearch.

The first result of the contest was included in the submission, demonstrating the individual's skills and efforts. Further optimization of the models, such as feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning, can potentially improve the accuracy of the predictions and increase the chances of winning the contest.
